# 💻 Project:

In this project I tried to replicate the Twitter interface with ReactJS. <br />
I used the react-responsive lib to verify screen sizes, the react-sticky-box lib to make some containers sticky and the styled-icons lib to get the icons. <br />
I made it responsive and used the following breakpoints: <br />

- < 500px
- greater ou equal than 500px
- greater ou equal than 1000px
- greater ou equal than 1280px
